// THIS IS WIP

// STRINGS METHODS

// Instructions:
// Complete the functions below and check to see if your work is correct by
// running the tests in the testfile (open a terminal window and run
// "yarn watch" in the correct folder). All tests start with "xit",
// this means that they will be skipped. When you are ready to run a test, just
// remove the "x" (so it says "... it("assumption")...".)
// You can find all string methods here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String
// You can find the answers in the answers file, but please try to solve it first without checking the answers

// HINT: You could use

const cat = "tacocat";
const car = "Was it a car or a cat I saw?";

// anagram, uppercase, charAt
// remove numbers from string
// padstart

// Returns a string in uppercase
const getUpperCase = (string) => string.toUpperCase();

module.exports = {
  cat,
  car,
  getUpperCase,
};
